Lab 3 is about creating todo list, creating a simple calculator and analog and digital clock

In todo list we store the tasks in local storage
In simple calculator we use a method eval() to evaluate the string
In digital clock we use method Date and use getYears, getHours, getMinutes etc and write it in page and make its run dynamically with setInterval() method and in analog clock we used canvas
