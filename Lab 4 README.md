In Lab 4
we perform basic arithmetic calculation between two numbers by clicking 4 respective buttons with the help of JS,
alert individual characters from a provided string by running loop,
find whether a provided number is even or odd by checking the modulus by 2 with 0 or 1
and we reversed a string by running loop from length of string to 0
