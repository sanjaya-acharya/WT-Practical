In Lab 5,
we changed visibility of elements using JS,
learned about the property position and its values (absolute, relative, fixed, sticky) and stacking elements by changing the property "z-index"  through JS,
displayed dynamic contents by using setInterval() method,
learned to drag and drop elements by using events like ondrag, draggable, etc,
validated a form by providing some conditions to password and other fields.
